#Install BWA
conda install bwa
-------------------

#Create the index for the reference genome
bwa index -p hg38bwaidx -a bwtsw hg38_truncated.fa

#hg38_truncated.fa is the truncated small file instead of hg38.fa
#Note 1: index creation only needs to be performed once (the index does not have to be recreated for every alignment job).
#Note 2: for small genomes, use -a is instead 
-------------------

#Mapping short reads to the reference genome, eg hg38
bwa aln -t 4 hg38bwaidx fastqfile.txt >  sequence.txt.bwa

#hg38bwaidx will be the prefix to all the files created with the command
#fastqfile.txt is the fastq file for reads created in ngs_sim.py python script which is to aligned to the ref genome
-------------------

#Create alignment in the SAM format (a generic format for storing large nucleotide sequence alignments): 
bwa samse hg38bwaidx sequence.txt.bwa fastqfile.txt > sequence.txt.sam
#sequence.txt.bwa bwa file created in the previous command
#alignment is stored in sequence.txt.sam
#out.bam file is also created through this command
